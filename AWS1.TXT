// AWS(amazon web service) //

=> cloud computing => sharing of resources via internet(remotely)

// characterestics of cloud //
1 on demand self service
2 Broad network access
3 scalability => up/down
4 resouce pooling
5 measured service

// CLOUD MARKET //
MICROSOFT AZURE
GOOGLE CLOUD
AWS CLOUD
VM,ORACLE,ALIBABA ETC

// certificates //
aws solution architect => beg
aws Devops
aws sysops 

IAAS => only hardware like network , storage , server ,virtualization , os 
PAAS => IASS + runtime,middleware
SAAS => IASS+PAAS+application,data

Public cloud 
Private
Hybrid => both public and private

// there two type storage instance //
EC2(elastic compute cloud) instance => scalable computing machine
instance == vm
EC2 = AWS
VM  = Microsoft
EBS(elastic block stroage) => external storage(NAS)
instance storage => internal storage(DAS)
   non-persistent (RAM,CACHED data DELETE)
  paid because direct attach server aws
20 instance create in region per A/C
ex=  mumbai => 20
     USA => 20

// type of instance/vm //
general purpose instance =>  Balanced memeory and ram
compute optimized => more cpu than ram
memoery   "       => more ram
accelerated/gpu    => gameing best
storage  "      => low latency 
high memeory " => high ram ,nitro system

// general purpose instance //
   Balanced memeory ,ram , networking and variety of workload
   #A series
     A1 => medicum+large
     paid
   #M series 
     only large 
     paid
     EBS
     m4,m5,m5a,m5ad,m5d etc
   #T series 
     t2,t3,t3a
     micro
     free

// instance purchasing policy //
read online policy
1 on demand 
2 dedicated instance
3 dedicated host
4 spot instance
5 schedule instance
6 reserved instance

// instance access //
=> key and key pair name
   public key = AWS
   private key => user download only ones
   RDP OR SSH(without key pair not access)
   

// root volume //
EBS VS INSTANCE
EBS store
instance store
AMIs backed by EC2 instance store and AMIs backed by EBS.
AWS recommends use of EBS backed AMIs, because they launch faster and use persistent storage.
Data on an instance store volume persists only during the life of the associated instance 
if an instance is stopped or terminated, any data on instance store volumes is lost.


// ip alloacte //
instance release then public(dynamic) ip release
instances retain private ip4/ip6
elastic ip => static ip with paid ex = used by website 
when instance is release then elastic ip not release

// instance metadata //
non encrypted
group,ip4,ami-id,local-hostname etc
http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata

// VPC VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD //

// storage aws //
#simple storage service(s3)
 object level storage 
 ex = movice , pdf etc
#elastic file system(EFS)
 center storage 
 linux based system
#EBS(elastic block storage) 
  instance kay sath hoti hai
 #galicer/s3 galicer 
  long term stoarge  hoti hai
  ex = old song  
#showball
